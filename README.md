Omni Food NextJs

This project is to convert Jonas Schmedtmann's Omni Food app into Next.js code.
This app is from Jonas's Udemy course "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS".

The running app can be seen on the web at
https://omnifood.dev/

I have already built this app once using vanilla HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
I have the full source code for the finished app.

The goal of this project is to rebuild the app in Next.js.
All of the text content, logos, images, design decisions etc. are already available.

The app will be built with -

- no TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- three media breakpoints - mobile, tablet, desktop (this is different from the vanilla html app)
- no pre-built UI components, all hand rolled using Tailwind
- Next.js App router
